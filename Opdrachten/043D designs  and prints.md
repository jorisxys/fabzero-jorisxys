# 04 Learn design techniques and how to print things in 3D

**WEEK4**  

----------------
This week we learned about several kinds of Additive manufacturing. We also learned the history behind it and how it just recently lost its patent. 
* additive manufacturing
    * 3d printing 
    * fdm 
    * sla/dpla 

----------------
|benefits|negatives|
|less waste|Not the fastest proces|
|custom builds|material cost|
|relatively complex builds|startup cost|
|efficient|Precision|
----------------
these several methods are being used in: 
* architecture
* the medical sector 
* art 
* fasion
----------------
----------------
1. digital design through cad software.
2. slicing: generating the path the printer nozzle will travel and print on.
3. printing the actual design with a 3d printer
### 3d design sofware 
* Tinkercad
* freecad 
* blender 
----------------
how to make the most optimal 3d print. 
#### using supports is generally bad
* more time/money to print 
* more chance on mistakes
* the final print will have traces of supports
##### how to remove supports/avoid ?
* rotate/ position for less overhang
* print in steps and glue together
* set a personal limit on the angle of overhang. 
  * a good one is based on Y H T 
## our task this week 

**design** and print a pencil add on that fits.

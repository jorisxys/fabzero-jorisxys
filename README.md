## passions

I don't really have a passion. The closest things that someone could see as a passion of mine are: Learning, Reading and making things.

## why-did-I-decide-to-join? 

I love to tinker and make stuf. I also value my freedom and I think that the skills and things that I will learn could help me achieve that.
